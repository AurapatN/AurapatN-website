# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

The Medicinal Chemistry Laboratory at XXX focuses on discovering and developing new synthetic methodologies to efficiently prepare pharmaceutically relevant molecules, especially those in the tetrahydroisoquinoline, cisplatin, indane, isobenzofuran, naphthalene, napthalacton, tetrazole, napthryridine, and carboline families. We investigate both the classical thermal conditions and the alternative photochemical/electrochemical pathways with the ultimate goal of harnessing the environmentally benign protocols in the preparation of small-molecule pharmaceuticals.
